## HONORS HOMEWORK: 
**Programming Problem Survey**
Version 25.04.16

**Due Date:**  Friday, May 16th, 11:59.59pm

**Description:** Open an account on the kattis problem archive:
https://open.kattis.com/. Select 10 of the attached listed problems and write a report about the solutions for your selected problems. 
For each of the the solutions of your selected problems, report on:


**The algorithmic technique used:**
>One of "brute-force", "reduce-and-conquer", "divide-and-conquer", "transform-and-conquer", "dynamic programming", and/or any other relevant description of the solution's algorithm. 
Justify your answer.


**Complexity class:**
>The time complexity of the runtime function of the algorithm.
Justify your answer by identifying the basic operation(s) and stating any other relevant information.


**Correctness:**
>Make an argument on the correctness of the algorithm used.
Frame your argument in terms of a loop invariant for iterative algorithms, and induction, for recursive algorithms .


*Submit your report by email as an attached typed PDF document.*

# Notes

ðŸŽ² Since their were 30 problems I chose them by rolling a d10 die for the ones place (treating the 10 as a 0) and a d6 for the tens place. A 1-2 was for the 0, 3-4 was for 1, and 5-6 was for 2. ðŸŽ²

I did skip chocolate chip fabrication cause I couldn't understand what it wanted and I skipped Movie Night because I was running low on time and that would've been a very hard one.
